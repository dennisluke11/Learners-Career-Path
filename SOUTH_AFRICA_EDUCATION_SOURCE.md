## Grade Levels

For our application, we focus on **FET Phase (Grades 10-12)**:
- **Grade 10** - First year of FET
- **Grade 11** - Second year of FET
- **Grade 12** - Final year, NSC examinations (Matric)

## Curriculum Policy

- **National Curriculum Statement (NCS)** Grades R-12
- **Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statements (CAPS)** - Subject-specific policy documents
- **Three-Stream Model** (introduced 2024-2025):
  - Academic stream
  - Occupational stream
  - Technical stream

## Recent Changes (2024-2025)

1. **New Vocational Subjects** (Occupational Stream):
   - Ancillary Health Care
   - Motor Mechanics
   - Welding
   - Hospitality
   - Electrical Technology
   - Civil Technology
   - Technical Sciences

2. **Coding and Robotics**:
   - Being piloted in many schools
   - Intended for broader rollout

3. **Entrepreneurship Education**:
   - Compulsory in many schools

## Subject Naming Conventions

### Official Names (as per CAPS):
- **Physical Sciences** (not "Physics" - it includes both Physics and Chemistry)
- **Life Sciences** (not "Biology")
- **Mathematical Literacy** (not "Math Literacy")
- **Computer Applications Technology** (CAT)
- **Engineering Graphics and Design** (EGD)

### Language Subjects:
- Format: `[Language Name] (Home Language)` or `[Language Name] (First Additional Language)`
- Examples:
  - English (Home Language)
  - English (First Additional Language)

## Verification Checklist

When updating South African education data, verify against:

- [ ] DBE official CAPS documents
- [ ] NSC Subject Choice documentation
- [ ] Latest DBE policy announcements
- [ ] Umalusi assessment standards
- [ ] Provincial education department variations (if applicable)

## Notes for Implementation

1. **Physical Sciences** is a combined subject (Physics + Chemistry), but we map it to `Physics` for internal consistency
2. **Chemistry** is technically part of Physical Sciences, but listed separately for career requirements
3. **Life Sciences** = Biology (mapped to `Biology` internally)
4. Students typically take **7 subjects total** (4 compulsory + 3 electives)
5. Some subjects may vary by school/province availability
