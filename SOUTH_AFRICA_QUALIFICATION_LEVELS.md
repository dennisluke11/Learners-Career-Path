## Achievement Ratings (NSC)

## APS (Admission Point Score) System

Most universities use **APS** to calculate admission scores:

| NSC Rating | Percentage | APS Points |
|------------|------------|-----------|

| 1 | 0-29% | 1 |

**Note**: Life Orientation typically counts for **1 point** (not included in subject requirements)

**Example**: 
- Mathematics: 70% (Rating 6) = 6 APS points
- Physical Sciences: 65% (Rating 5) = 5 APS points
- Life Sciences: 60% (Rating 5) = 5 APS points
- English: 55% (Rating 4) = 4 APS points
